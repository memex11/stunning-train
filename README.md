# stunning-train
I made a program from a pygame tutorial walkthrough it looks from "invent with python" in 2015. 
The program makes my former coworkers circle the border of a screen. 
Github suggested this repo name and I accept their suggestion

fontsnstuffcopy.py is the second version with the pictures inside the same directory.
